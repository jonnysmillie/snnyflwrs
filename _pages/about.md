## Sonny Flowers is a writer and curator. All of Sonny Flowers's work is published on this website in the form of articles and lists. The work provides opinionated reviews and discussions of art, film, literature, philosophy, politics, technology, and more.

### [Articles](/articles)

All articles are written in good faith. They are general discussions about topics that are dear to the writer (and hopefully to the reader too). They are not invitations for contact. If you would like to provide feedback on an article please do so here.

### [Lists](/lists)

All lists are attempts to rank the quality of a certain subset of media or products. Sometimes no criteria of quality other than personal taste. Other times a ranking system may well be followed. Lists group together different items of interest in an order of relevance and significance. If you would like to provide feedback on a list please do so here.
