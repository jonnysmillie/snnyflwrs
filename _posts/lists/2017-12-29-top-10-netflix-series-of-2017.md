Archer is an American adult animated black spy sitcom created by Adam Reed for the digital cable network FXX.

Reed devised Archer following the cancellation of his Adult Swim comedy Frisky Dingo. The pilot premiered on FX as a preview screening on September 17, 2009, and by the show’s seventh season, it was moved to FXX’s broadcast lineup. Archer is produced using limited animation, and its visual style mirrors the aesthetic of mid-century comic art. The principal voice cast consists of H. Jon Benjamin, Aisha Tyler, Jessica Walter, Judy Greer, Amber Nash, Chris Parnell, and Lucky Yates, in addition to Reed. There have been a total of 98 episodes over the course of the show’s eight season. The ninth season is expected to air in 2018. Reed plans to conclude the series after its tenth season.

Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker, with Brooker and Annabel Jones serving as the programme's showrunners.

For the second season, Schnapp and Keery were promoted to series regulars, along with the additions of Sadie Sink, Dacre Montgomery, Sean Astin and Paul Reiser.

Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s, the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town including the appearance of a girl with psychokinetic abilities who helps the missing boy's friends in their own search. The second season, titled Stranger Things 2, is set a year after the first, and deals with attempts of the characters to return to normal and consequences that linger from the first season.

The Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside supernatural elements with childlike sensibilities, establishing its time frame in the 1980s and creating a homage to pop culture of that decade. Several themes and directorial aspects were inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King, among others, including several films, anime and video games.
